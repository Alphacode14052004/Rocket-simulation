## Features

- Realistic rocket launch simulation.
- Basic physics calculations for ascent.
- Crash animation to visualize failures.
- Cloud animations for enhanced visual effect.
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, Windows, Mac).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **C compiler**: GCC or any compatible C compiler.
- **CMake**: For building the project.
- **SDL2**: The Simple DirectMedia Layer library for graphics.
