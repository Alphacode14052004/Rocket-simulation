# Rocket Simulation

## Description

Rocket Simulation is an open-source project that simulates a rocket launch, showcasing basic physics and animations. The simulator allows users to visualize the rocket's ascent and view a simple crash animation, providing an educational tool for understanding rocket dynamics.

## Features

- Realistic rocket launch simulation.
- Basic physics calculations for ascent.
- Crash animation to visualize failures.
- Cloud animations for enhanced visual effect.
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, Windows, Mac).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **C compiler**: GCC or any compatible C compiler.
- **CMake**: For building the project.
- **SDL2**: The Simple DirectMedia Layer library for graphics.

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alphacode14052004/Rocket-simulation.git
   cd Rocket-simulation

Configure the Project Using CMake

Run the following command to configure the project:

bash

cmake ..

Compile the Project

After configuration, compile the project with:

bash

make

Run the Simulation

To run the simulation, execute:

bash

./rocket_simulator

Usage

After launching the simulation, you will see a visual representation of the rocket launching. The simulator includes clouds to indicate the rocket's ascent and a crash animation for demonstration purposes.
