## üìã Overview

Rocket Simulation is an open-source educational tool that demonstrates the principles of rocket physics through interactive visualization. Watch as your rocket battles gravity, breaks through clouds, and (occasionally) experiences dramatic failures - all while learning about the fundamentals of aerospace dynamics.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Physics Engine**: Real-time calculation of:
  - Thrust dynamics
  - Gravitational effects
  - Atmospheric resistance
- **Visual Elements**:
  - Dynamic cloud systems
  - Realistic launch sequences
  - Interactive crash animations
- **Cross-Platform Support**:
  - Linux
  - Windows
  - macOS
